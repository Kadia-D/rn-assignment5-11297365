This an app that allows a user track the payments or transactions made with his or her card.

The app was built with react-native, mainly to  have to screens that can be navigated to using a bottom tab navigator. The screens created are the  home screen and settings screen. 

There are a few unique elements on each screen. Both the transaction component and the transaction option component are included on the home screen. The name of the option and its icon are the two properties that the transaction option component receives. On the other hand, the transaction component gathers four inputs: the transaction name (i.e., what the money was spent on, like Spotify), the transaction cost, the transaction category, and the icon.

The settings screen uses one custom component,  name of the setting. This screen allows the user to choose the theme of their preference whether light or dark.
